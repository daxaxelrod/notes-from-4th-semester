briefs for 1-3-16

Gonzales V raich
    Mary Jane related
    whether or not the CSA (act that classifies drugs) was constitutional
    court decided it was because there were multiple precedents where (under congress''s power to regulate interstate commerce)
    even though the production of a commodity was local, like the farmer Wickard v Filborn, it has the ability to effect interstate markets which is under congress''s
    power to regulate
    the guy was growing extra wheat soley for the use on his farm but that took away demand from the entire market which effects the price

    theres another example case that i agree less with
        the gun control one (lopez v united states)
            congress controls the interstate commerce of weapons which is somehow effected by guns not being allowed in
            any school district


citizens united
    free speech
    statue 441b comes into play a lot
    bellotii v first national bank of boston doesnt preclude corperations from the right of free speech
    two conflicting cases
        austin and belloti
    austin restricts spending on politcal campaigns in order to prevent curruption
    they say that austin interferes with the open marketplace of ideas protected by the first ammendmentself.
        "most of the corperations effected by 441b are small corperations without large ammounts of wealth"
        note only is this a false statement, they directly contridict when they say that only 2000 of the millions of corperations in the us have super pacs
            shows that roughly only 2000 corperations find it a worthwile endevor to be active poilitically which skews the perception of the public by only allowin those
            with the financial resources to effect political outcomes

liquormart v rhode island
    advertising is super key to our democracy. ever since yee olden days we've ' needed it in order to sustain democracy
    they had to show that lack of alchohol advertising will signifigantly effect liquor sales
    they say "we cannot assert that a price advertising ban will signifigantly advance the states interest in promoting temperance"
        state is allowed to try to promote temperatce but this is not an effective way of doing so
