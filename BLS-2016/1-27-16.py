bls 111 class #2


the nature of law

Constitutions are the basic underlying structure for a form of government
    state and nation
    acts as a blue print
        establishes the way laws are created abd enforced
        also how the divisisions are established
            not highly specific

next source of law is a statute
    laws created by elected representives(legislative branch)
    published into statute books
        broken down into subjects

    uniform acts
        a body of proposed law
        usually composed by experts in the area, eg. lawyers
            example: universal commercial code

finally we have common law
    heres a bit on  how the courts are structured
        supreme court
            court of appeals (appelet court)
                Trial court

    common law is a bunch of laws that evolve over time
        used to cover legal matters that are not covered by statutes
        judge made law
        There is a hiearchy of common law
        every time a higher court makes a descision, akk the lower courts are obligated to follow ruling

    stare desicis (totally butchered the word) - let the past stand
        promotes stability
        law should be stable but not be still

    trend is increase of codification (going away from common law)
        although there are stil exceptions
            most Negligence cases are common law based

Equity
    equity courts were different than justice courts but they were merged
        types of remidy
            injunction (court ordered to do something)
            specific performance (forced sale of houses EG)

Administrative laws
    think fcc, faa fda,

priority rules
    federal law is superior to state and local
    constitutional law almost always prevails
        true at federal and state level
