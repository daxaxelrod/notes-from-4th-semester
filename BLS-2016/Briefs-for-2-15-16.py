Arthur Anderson V People of the u s of a
    Guy in charge of enrons accounting and auditing coerecd people to destroy documents in not line with company policy
    multiple emails were sent around saying an investigation would be really likely and that they should hold on to all their documents
    but they were being destroyed anyway
    He was convicted on the pretense that what he was doing was impeding governmental processes
        Supreme court argues that withholding documents or testimony is not enough to cause a conviction
            they give the example of a mother who suggests to her son to not testify and invoke the 5th
            also a wife who tells her husband to not disclose info on their marrage
        Upjohn co v united states cited
            they upheald that upjohn was justified in witholding documents to the irs because they were covered under attorney client privilage
        they also say a lot about how documents and thus information is withheld all the time in private business and is a common activity

    Bunch of stuff about the semantics of knowingly and curruptedself
    the jury was told in the trial judges instructions that """even if the petitioner honestly and sincerly believed that its conduct was
    lawful, you may still find the petitioner guilty""" they also diluted the meaning of curruply. because
    basically violated procedural law
