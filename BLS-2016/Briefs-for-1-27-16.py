        neligance

    Material Facts:

    lower courts ruling:
        lower court ruled in young""s favor
        becks appealed to AZ court of appeals who ruled in favor or mrs young,
        the becks went to the arizona supreme court

    Plaintiff and Defendent contentions
        the becks argued that the family purpose docturine (common law) was just a penalty against wealthy parents
        they beleived that since they laid out rules for their son, they should not be held liable

        mrs young wanted the family docturine upheld as a car given to a family memeber for the pleasure and general convinience of the
        memeber that the docturine should be upheld as this fits the criteria

    issue of the law:
        whether or not the family docturine should be ammended (it was a 90 year old piece of common law)

    Rules of law:
        The benton case is used as the primary reference as it was when the common law first came into practice
        they say that when the accident occured the defendents son was driving the family vehicle """in the very business for which the
        # the parent maintained the vehicle visa vi the pleasure and convenience of the memebers of the family""" as long as its driven for pleasure and convinience
        of the family member, the family purpose docturine holds

    applications of rules or facts:
        not exactly sure what this means
        amy young won the appeal

Trentadue V Gorton

    Title of the action:
        Plaintiff Dayle Trentadue, defendant: lots of people tangentially involoved in a murder
        parets, the corperations the rep of the women who rented the house the property managment company and two of the managment company''s employees
    Cause of action
        Negligence that lead to murder
    Material Facts
        the plaintiffs daughter was seeking damages after her mother was killed when she rented a house
        she wanted to sue the defendents for negligance that the house should have been protected and the parents of the
        killer because they should have vetted the murderer better
    Lower courts decision
        Trial court ruled against the defendants as the discovery common law was able to be enacted.
        the court of appeals affirmed this ruling. it was then taken to the michigan supreme court
    Plaintiff contentions and defendents contentions
        defendents wanted the case thrown out considering that the time of the crime was 22 years prior and the statute of limitations of 3 years
        should be upheld and thus trump the common law of discovery
        the plaintiff contended that since she had no knowledge of the murderer, there was no possible way she could make the nessisary accusations
        until the time of the trial. wanted the discovery rule upheld
    Issue of law
        Common low yields to statute
        statute of limitations and whether or not the trial could be legally heard
    rules of law
        michigan compiled law states that """ except where otherwise expressed the period of limitations runs from the time the claim accrues
        since this case is not one of medical malpractice, which is one of the very few exceptions, the statute of limitations holds """;
     applications of the rules to the facts
        again this doesnt make too much sense
