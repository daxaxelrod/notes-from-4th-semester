            microwaves dont work with door open
            websites asking for email twice

        Serivice after the sale
            its important that responsive service after a mishap with a customer
            ends often in a better perceptions of the supplier than if there was no mishap at all
            Its important to delight the customer`

    Measuing service performance
        throughput is not a good measure
            cases vary in complexity and scope
            traffic cases easier to close than murder cases
        utilization is not a good measure
            slow inefficient attorneys are going to be working all the time
            fast lawyers would have lower utilization

                promoter is 9 to 10
    recovering from service failures
        idetifying where failures are likly to occur
        identify how failures are detected and reported

        SIPOC
            suppliers inputs process output customer
            flow mapping
            when we first start to work a problem, first thing we should do is a sipoc

        servitization
            form of forward integration
            seen as the process of increasing value by adding services to products
            Eg. IBM consulting, Xerox maintenance, apple itunes and apple stores
        Servitization can lead to
            higher revenues but lower net profits
            bankrupcy
