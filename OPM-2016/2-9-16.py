often companies use mate (mean absolute percentage of error)
    1 - mate is a good accuracy measure to look at

Seasonal factoring
    total annual Demand average for past few years
    do the same for the past years quarters
    determine percentage of each average quarter compared to average annual Demand
    find the percentage of the total each quarter stands for

    most companies have a base of temps

    upper and lower control limit (calculated to 3 standard deviation)
    stnrd devs on the y axis, period on the x axis
        meant to show the deviation of the accuracy and variation in forecasts
