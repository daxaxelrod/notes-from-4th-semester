opm 311
class #3


Starting right off the bat with high performance
    Documented method to increase the discipline of standard practices
    Management systems generally include:
        definition of good procedures and practices (process design)
        accountability infrastructure (management systems) such as
            daily schedule
            weekly performance review
            monthly meeting (sales and ops planning)
        measurements of success
            metrics, backward looking performance
    Basics of opm

was there an issue with the plan itself? or was it the exicution

Root cause analysis
    (Also known as an a3 report)
    a type of report with trend, charts actions and names associated with them
    accurate date and accountability measurements
    Pareto chart
        the guy who invented the 80 /20 rule
        you should have know that axelrod
paretos law
    20% of products and customers
    account for 80% of the revenue
    segregate how we control different levels of inventory based on volume
Hoshin planning (means compass needle)
    needs a clear direction from the company
        tactical objectives
        business imperatives
            exicutes
                actions items

Supply chain strat
    creating strategic relationships
    improves strategic value (raymond caterpillar and toyota)
    may allow a compay to share a core competency
        pepsi does logistics for other companies
    establish longer term relationships

Types of supply chain relationships
    transactional
        lowest cost
        arms length transations or reverse auctions
        no expectation of repeat business
        the descision of abstaining from reverse auctions was intrumental to strategic planning
    complementary
        borrows value from strategic partners
        eg toyota is good at building cars but doest own the dealerships
    synergistic
        partnering to create answers and unique value

metrics
    sheldon consulting observation
        Barometric measurements
            are all the same in all businesss
            tell you if youre about to head into a storm
                eg measuring customer service
                also data accuracy
                10-13 in sheldon model
            dont really indicate root cause
        Diagnostic measurements
            are different for everyone
            support root cause analysis
            test the sustainability of specific changes
            can go away until you've satisfied root cause'

Globalization
    dont forget that you want to be in th us first (biggest market)
sustainability
    the saving of resources for future generations
    not trying to but being effective in this area

Capacity
    is how much resource do we have to produce product in a specific market
    resource planning is out 12 months at a minimum
    next is rough cut Capacity planning
        facility level
        where are the constains in businesss that are going to effect our capability
            bottle necks
    Materials planning
        SKu centric
            machine and single product based
    BE very aware of scalability
        how fast can our business increase Capacity
    defining and measuring cap (pg 287)
    (3 types)
    theoretical capacity (design capacity)
    effective (called available in text) (design minus things we know (breaks, vacations other realisms))
    demonstrated (called actual) (stop thinking about imaginative capacity)
        demonstrated is where the real money is

    Deciding when to add capacity
        start big cap or be responsive

    theory of constraints
        constraints somthing that limits the performance of a process or system in achieving its goal
        1st step
            understand the bottleneck (WHOS NOT PRODUCING RESULTS in software)
        2nd
            exploit the constraint
            run through breaks/ run 24 hours a day
            dont spend money yet. but always have the bottleneck running
        3rd
            make sure that other portions of the process are supportive
                place a buffer in front of the first operation and in front of the process step
        4th
            look for ways to increase cap
            more equipment, more people
        5th
            listen for drumbeat in the constrained activity
            Use the feedback in constraint in 3 to signal begginneing operation
