Ken class homework assignment week 2

visit 12 businesses and ask them the 3 things that they could do to make them more profitable

Im make a trip downtown today for the assignment for two reasons. one I dont have a car and the busses only run a few select places. Two, downtown Binghamtonton
has the highest concentration of small businesses in the area. Lots of small shows, small eateries, the works.

Been here since 11ish and its now 12:30

Im noticing a few trends

first and foremost is that there are a lot of businesses that are either closed or the owner is not there. tons of locked door
    tons of people just working there without a clue as to whats going on managerially.
    Gave a lot of people my card but i dont have high hopes that i will get a call or email back

Second thing is that Ive been beat to a majority of businesses. The ones where the manager is there, they say "oh is this the 3 ways that we could improve our business"
    "we did that yesterday"
        'Would you mind doing the interview again?'
    "not right now, super busy. would you mind coming back __insert time i have class or would be impossible for me to come downtown here__"

    So its now 12:33 and i have 0 of 12 interviews and i have to get back to campus for rehersal at 1:30, I will try a few more

sweet jesus let me just get one



Update. it is now 1:40. back at school. late for rehersal
the rest of the morning was entirly fruitless. visited the lost dog and jakes wine and liquor with 0 progress. was going to try more but had a major
whiteout on the skateboard. ripped my pants and my motivation to shreds


Coming back at 7:32
have a ton of audio from the day, wonder how i can present in video format

Interview with Ron Axelrod
    raxelrod@rttsweb.com

    what are 3 things that could be more profitable to your corp in the future
        given reliabe student help
    1. higher quality of applicants. testing solutions require extensive knowledge of testing library''s
            people coming out of univeristies dont have sufficiant testing knowlegde but vast knowledge in the algorithm space
            its kind of like the universities are trying to prep all their kids for interviews at google and facebook but completely ignoring the rest of the market
    2. Larger sales force for internal projects. they have a product developed in house and its production ready. he needs a salesforce to find companies migrating their
            DBs and need to be testedself.
    3. People dedicated to SEO engine optimization. easy fixes but number of people who can work on it are all occupied

Interveiw with Katherine Jennings

    3 things that could make your business more profitable
            given reliable student help
    1. social media marketing
    2. Larger sales force for ansilary businesses. (driving school, boating school, mortage review services)
    3. Higher quality of applicants for open positions. Little anecdote here. Right before we got on the phone, she finished
        an interview with an applicant for a bookkeeping position. They women who was there for the interview was mid 20s and extremely professional. se graduated from
        local university with a degree in actuarial science. When Kathy started the technical portion of the interview, the interviewee fell flat on her face. she """didnt know 99% of quickbooks which was mentioned in the
        job descritpion as a must have skill""". she wishes there was a better way for vetting technical skills before spending the time to do an interview

Interview with Shawn Graber VooLoo LLC
    sgraber1@Binghamtonton.edu
    Shawn owns a small consulting shop that has done extensive work for botique finance firms in new york city

    3 things
    1. He knows no web design and has built a site using squarespace and it looks ok. He would like it to be a bit more professional but he also wants to build a portal for compliments
    to be able to measure progress on certain projects
    2. Data mining. These firms have large databases of customer names, addresses and other information but alot of it is not consistant. one of his biggest jobs right now it to
    consolidate those fragmented databases into a stardard contacts DB but it requires a lot of time
    3. Customized CRM system design and implementation. There have been several times when shawn has been approached by firms who need CRM solutions. shawn has been able to exicute on a few of them
    but has missed out on a few deals where the client needed a salesforce crm with a few extra modules.

Welp thats all I have, besides the audio recordings from wednesday (available upon request)
