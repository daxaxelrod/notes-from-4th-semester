home work done

y combinator has taken 1000 plus ideas
best of the best apply

vast majority (90%) have bad ideaas
HERES WHY


tendency to chase first ideas
most big projects are bred from small projects
    its ok to plunge into one of these projects
        but having invested time but that doesnt make it valueable

Pleasent work does not pay
    people will do for free what they enjoy (fun things)
    playing games listening to music watching moveis
    eating drinking talking to people
    developing programming languages, doing research
unpleasant work pays
    it doesnt have to be disgusting, just hard
    a venture has to make money
        at least enough to support founders
        founders need to focus
Timidity
    fear of competition, lack of confidence
    "there must be another company that does this"

    Lack of business experience
        business is simply a set of learnable skills
        figuring out what people need or want
        people skills
        how much to charge for somethong

Where does pain come from
    pain is when things change
    everything is relitivistic. people compare themselves to others
    allow them to do that

how do you know the world has changed
    unexpeected failures
        used to work, now doesnt work
    unexpected success - what used to never work, now works
    Incongruities - increasing effort does not lead to improved results (indicator - this doesnt make sense)
    employee frustration - "theres gotta be a better way"

Common business responses to change
    ignore the change (nahhh fuck that lets not work on that)
    tackling adversity head-on, instead of leveraging
    addressing challenges with old frames of references
    thinking small when challenges are big
peter drucker''s innovation and entrepreneurship
    change is normal
    change is healthy
    druckers 4 main types of change
        changes in demographics
        changes in socio economic perspectives
        changes in market structure/processes
        changes in knowledge

you cant buy motivation, engagement confidence, happiness and optimisn
