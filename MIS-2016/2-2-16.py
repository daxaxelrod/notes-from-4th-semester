Firms strive for sustainable competitive advantage
    financial performance that consistently out performs industry averages
    Not fucking easy

using a guy named Micheal porter
    value chain
    and porters 5 forces

    under value chain
        avoid sameness as it will errode margins
        there is also the fast follower problem
            me too products
        a technology itself cannot be enough to stave off competitors

    in order to have a sustainable comp advantage
        need to have 4 resources in the co
            valueable
            rare
            imperfectly imitable
            non-sustainable
